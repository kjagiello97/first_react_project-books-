Hi,

I am Kacper, I am Chemical and Process Engineer with management skills and I am learning how to code in React.

This project is my very first approach to React (January 2026) where I experiment with HTML, CSS and JS in presenting my top 4 books with some fun forms.

The App is not perfect; however, it is mine :) 

Next will be better (maybe).

I am learning React via Udemy course Complete React, Next.js & TypeScript Projects Course 2025. 

This and next apps will be shared via Github and netlify (probably).

The goal is to build my portfolio to be able to rebranch in 2027 into IT.

If you are reading it there are three options:
1) You are recruiter (thank you for taking me into concideretion whereever I sent my CV)
2) You are Oliwia, Marcin or Weronika (hi there! :) )
3) You are very lost and have too much free time XD

Nevertheless, I hope you like what you see!

KJ
